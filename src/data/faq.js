        answer: "The fresher the account, the more it is sensible to actions in the first days of use, and more likely to ask for phone verification at login or after a few actions. The more aged, the more it can endure. However, while aged accounts can easily accept login from other locations and resist at more daily actions, it is safer to warm up any account regardless of age, like proceeding with only a few actions daily, for a few days. If fresh accounts are warmed up properly, in time they can be as much as effective as aged accounts.\n",

        question: "How to safely phone verify social media accounts?",
        answer: "\n\n\nPV solution 1: The best and safest method to phone verify social accounts are real sim numbers, you could either buy them in your country or off Ebay, at rates between $0.2 – $1 / sim card. If the sim cards are from a foreign country, you should make sure the sim has area coverage in your country and it doesn’t charge extra tax for receiving SMS’s locally. Advantages: Real numbers are considered to be the most trusted by social networks, also by being the single owner of the number it will ensure no further use for other accounts, which could put the accounts at risk. Downsides: It can get expensive and time consuming.\nPV solution 2: Using free SMS apps like Textnow, Textplus, Nextplus. Advantages: No costs. Downsides: Valid numbers (working area codes) are hard to find so it will take some time to successfully PV accounts; Because these are virtual numbers, sometimes IG can see them as suspicious.\nPV solution 3: Using online SMS verify services, but avoid Chinese and Russian numbers. I can’t vouch for any mainstream providers right now. – Advantages: You can easily verify accounts from a provided dashboard, or if you have plenty of accounts to verify, you can automate the process with the site API. Downsides: Numbers might be reused at some point, or they can be flagged as spammy by social networks, thus, you might get a re-PV or even instant bans after PV! So please treat this method with caution when verifying accounts (verify only 1-2 accs at first, and wait for a while to see if the accounts are in good standing).\n\n\n",
